# Namma Yatri Open Mobility Challenge: Empowering Drivers 🚗

## Problem Statement 3: Skill Development 📚

### The Challenge 🌟
The Namma Yatri Open Mobility Challenge is an open initiative that encourages the development of innovative solutions to tackle mobility issues. In the March 2023 edition of the open challenge, we present 10 challenges across three tracks: Future of Mobility, Driver Enablement, and Namma Yatri. Problem Statement 3 falls under the Driver Enablement track, with a focus on digitally empowering drivers to help them earn on par with their peers.

### The Problem 🤔
Our drivers come from diverse backgrounds and generations, and it's evident that not all of them are tech-savvy, especially those from older generations. Despite technological advancements, our apps and features can't add value unless they're widely adopted. We face several challenges:

- **Driver's resistance to change.** They may be hesitant to embrace new technology.
- **Language barriers.** Not all drivers are comfortable with a single language.
- **Unviable business models.** Ensuring fair earnings for drivers is crucial.
- **Unengaging content/training.** The training may not capture their interest.
- **Lack of accountability and monitoring systems.** Ensuring adherence to standards is challenging.

## The Goal 🥅
Our goal is to discover innovative solutions for digitally empowering drivers and improving their technological literacy. Solutions should focus on developing engaging, user-friendly content and training that's accessible and understandable by drivers of all ages and backgrounds. Overcoming language barriers is crucial. We aim to create viable business models and incorporate accountability and monitoring systems to ensure drivers can earn on par with their peers.

## Solution 💡
We propose the development of a user-friendly app designed to address the challenges faced by less tech-savvy drivers. This app will provide easy access to essential information and training, featuring multi-language support, engaging content, and monitoring systems. Our vision is to create a tool that enables drivers to learn and earn better.
